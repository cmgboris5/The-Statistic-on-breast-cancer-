# Breast Cancer Dataset Analysis

## Project Motivation
About 1 in 8 U.S. women (about 13%) will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime. In 2022, an estimated 287,850 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed in women in the U.S., along with 51,400 new cases of non-invasive (in situ) breast cancer.

# Business Understanding
> This is an analysis of the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) DataSet, obtained from Kaggle We are going to analyze it keeping in mind the following Questions.
    
   * How many Females are affeced by Breast Cancer?
   * How many surgeries done per year? 
   * What is the Death Ratio from Breast Cancer?

## How many Females are affeced by Breast Cancer?
   * 317 Females are affected by Breast Cancer in our Dataset.
   * Visualise
   * Brief explanation for visualisation
   
## How many surgeries done per year? 
   * Total surgries done in 2018 are 147, 2019 are 113, 2017 are 57.
   * Visualise
   * Brief explanation for visualisation
   
## How many person died from Breast Cancer?
   * Alive: 252, Dead : 65
   * Visualise

## About Dataset Attribute
This dataset consists of a group of breast cancer patients, who had surgery to remove their tumour. The dataset consists of the following variables:

**Patient_ID**: unique identifier id of a patient

**Age**: age at diagnosis (Years)

**Gender**: Male/Female

Protein1, Protein2, Protein3, Protein4: expression levels (undefined units)

**Tumour_Stage**: I, II, III

**Histology**: Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma, Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma, Mucinous Carcinoma

**ER status**: Positive/Negative

**PR status**: Positive/Negative

**HER2 status**: Positive/Negative

**Surgery_type:** Lumpectomy, Simple Mastectomy, Modified Radical Mastectomy, Other

**DateofSurgery:** Date on which surgery was performed (in DD-MON-YY)

**DateofLast_Visit:** Date of last visit (in DD-MON-YY) [can be null, in case the patient didn’t visited again after the surgery]

**Patient_Status**: Alive/Dead [can be null, in case the patient didn’t visited again after the surgery and there is no information available whether the patient is alive or dead].

## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.



## File Description
There are 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above question. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. Furthermore there is dataset file also available.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available.
